h1. RubyProf/JSON

This is a small project that adds a JSON printer to RubyProf to enable easy processing and querying of profiled sessions. Note that the JSON schema may change.

h2. Usage

For now (at least), usage is limited to scripts that directly call RubyProf's API (and not the `ruby_prof` scriptâ€”I can't see an easy way to register a new formatter without directly manipulating the script).

<pre><code>
# Assuming `result` is a RubyProf::Result
printer = RubyProf::JsonPrinter.new(result)
printer.print(output)
</code></pre>
